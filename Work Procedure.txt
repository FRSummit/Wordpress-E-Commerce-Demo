8. We need to create user for configuration. Go to phpmyadmin and select our database. Now go to Previleges and create a new user. Ex: [User Name: frsummit, Password: 12345]. Set Global arevileges 'check all'. Now save it as click 'Go'.

Step 2: Custom Theme Development
=================================
17. Open our project file to VS Code editor.
18. Open wp-content folder. Here we can see plugins, theme, uploads folder and index.php file.
        wp-content: The wp-content folder is an integral part of any WordPress installation, which is why you find it in the main directory of any site built with the WordPress platform. It houses any content provided by users that is not saved in the database. That includes plugins, themes and uploaded media.
        plugin : This will contatin the plugins f our projct.
        theme  : This one houses all the themes on your site. We can create our custom theme here.
        uploads: WordPress stores all your image and media uploads in this folder. By default, uploads are organized in /year/month/ folders. Whenever you are creating a WordPress backup, you should include uploads folder.
        index.php: The index. php file in the root of wp-content.

19. Now open wp-content > themes folder. There are already 3 default themes is present and an index.php file. We can remove all these themes and create our custom theme. But never delete index.php file. This file is the root of our theme.
20. Now create a new folder inside theme folder and named it as your custom theme name. Ex: frskynet
21. We need to create some php and css files to intrtoduct our theme folder 'frskynet' to wordpress that it is our theme and every theme has these default files. These are [style.css, index.php, functions.php, page.php, single.php, front-page.php, header.php, footer.php, archive.php, search.php, 404.php]
22. But in this case we are going to create these folder step by step.
23. Now create 2 files -> index.php and style.css. These are the base file of our theme. Without these files we can't do anything.
24. Now open any style.css file from other theme [twentynineteen, twentyseventeen, twentynitwenty] and copy the informations which are commented there and paste it to our theme's style.css. Now change the informations as out theme.
                Ex: 
                /*
                        Theme Name: F R Skynet
                        Text Domain: F R Summit
                        Version: 1.0
                        Author: F R Summit
                        Author URI: https://frsummit.github.io/
                        Description: F R Summit
                */
