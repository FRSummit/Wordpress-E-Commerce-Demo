WORDPRESS E-COMMERCE TUTORIAL & WORK PROCEDURE STEP BY STEP
===================================================================

Step 1: Default Site create
=====================================
1. Download latest wordpress - you will get a zip/rar file
2. Move rar file to xampp > htdocs and extract it there. Change the extract folder name as your project name.
3. Go to browser and open 'http://localhost:8080/phpmyadmin' and create a new database for your project.
4. Open your project into a new browser tab. Ex: 'http://localhost:8080/wordpress-ecommerce'. It will open wordpress language settings page.
5. Select Language as English (United State). Default it is selected. Now click continue.
6. Now you can see an information page where wordpress suggest you about database setup. As we setup our database we don't need to worry about it. Click 'Let's go'.
7. Now you need to give database information which we created before.
8. We need to create user for configuration. Go to phpmyadmin and select our database. Now go to Previleges and create a new user. Ex: [User Name: frsummit, Password: 12345]. Set Global arevileges 'check all'. Now save it as click 'Go'.
9. Now open our wordpress site. Give the information which we just created. As we are using our local server so we set Database Host as localhost Set your custom prefix. Ex: frs_. Now click submit.
10. You can see the installation information. Click 'Run Installation'.
11. Give your wordpress site Title, Username, Password, email. Ex: [ Title: FR SKYNET, Username: frsummit, Password: frs@123, Email: frsummit1@gmail.com ]
12. Now click 'Install Wordpress'. It takes some seconds to instal. After you see Success message, click 'Login'.
13. Use your site information to login.
14. After login you can see the admin pannel of your wordpress site.
15. Move your cursor to top left Title and you can see 'Visit Site'. Click there and you can see your default site.
16. If we notice out database we can see there are 12 table created when we install wordpress. They are frs_commentmeta, frs_comments, frs_links, frs_options, frs_postmeta, frs_posts, frs_termmeta, frs_terms, frs_term_relationships, frs_term_taxonomy, frs_usermeta, frs_users.

Step 2: Custom Theme Development
=====================================
17. Open our project file to VS Code editor.
18. Open wp-content folder. Here we can see plugins, theme, uploads folder and index.php file.
                wp-content: The wp-content folder is an integral part of any WordPress installation, which is why you find it in the main directory of any site built with the WordPress platform. It houses any content provided by users that is not saved in the database. That includes plugins, themes and uploaded media.
                plugin    : This will contatin the plugins f our projct.
                theme     : This one houses all the themes on your site. We can create our custom theme here.
                uploads   : WordPress stores all your image and media uploads in this folder. By default, uploads are organized in /year/month/ folders. Whenever you are creating a WordPress backup, you should include uploads folder.
                index.php : The index. php file in the root of wp-content.

19. Now open wp-content > themes folder. There are already 3 default themes is present and an index.php file. We can remove all these themes and create our custom theme. But never delete index.php file. This file is the root of our theme.
20. Now create a new folder inside theme folder and named it as your custom theme name. Ex: frskynet
21. We need to create some php and css files to intrtoduct our theme folder 'frskynet' to wordpress that it is our theme and every theme has these default files. These are [style.css, index.php, functions.php, page.php, single.php, front-page.php, header.php, footer.php, archive.php, search.php, 404.php]
22. But in this case we are going to create these files step by step.
23. Now create 2 files -> index.php and style.css. These are the base file of our theme. Without these files we can't do anything.
24. Now open any style.css file from other theme [twentynineteen, twentyseventeen, twentynitwenty] and copy the informations which are commented there and paste it to our theme's style.css. Now change the informations as out theme.
                Ex: 
                /*
                        Theme Name: F R Skynet
                        Text Domain: F R Summit
                        Version: 1.0
                        Author: F R Summit
                        Author URI: https://frsummit.github.io/
                        Description: F R Summit
                        Text Domain: flipmart
                */

Theme Image setup
=====================================
25. Now open browser and go to Appearance > Theme. We can see our theme is there but there is no profile/cover image. To create our theme image follow bellow steps.
                1. Select your theme image and open it in paint or photoshop.
                2. Resize that image as 1200x900 (width x height).
                3. Rename it as 'screenshot'.
                4. Save it.
                5. Go to browser Appearance > Theme and reload it. You can see the image for your theme.
                6. Click on 'Theme Details', we can see the details which we had added in style.css file.
26. Click 'Activate' to activate our theme.
27. Now reload our site. You can see nothing as we hadn't added any code in our theme index.php file.

Adding code in index.php [We will use flipmart html template for this development tutorial]
=============================================================================================
28. Download flipmart template and extract it.
29. Copy home.html code and paste it to our index.php file, copy assets folder and paste it to our theme folder.
30. Reload site. We can see the broken page or no style page. Lets do it dynamic style.

Make Dynamic index.php file
=====================================
31. Open index.php file and notice the stylesheet link.
32. Add <?php get_template_directory_uri(); ?> before href url assets/..... . It should be echo. So modify that as <?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>
                Ex:
                        if link is like => <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/bootstrap.min.css">
                        modify it like  => <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/assets/css/bootstrap.min.css">

33. If we want to make it secure code put that inside esc_url() function.
                Ex:
                        <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo esc_url(get_template_directory_uri()); ?>/assets/css/bootstrap.min.css">
34. Now do it for all assets like css, js, images or something else. Just replace 'assets/' to '<?php echo esc_url(get_template_directory_uri()); ?>/assets/'
35. Now reload our site. We can see the index page properly.
36. Actually what we have done till now, it is not a proper way or right way. We just want to see our page and test that everythins works properly. This is why we use get_template_directory() function. If we want to make all this thing in a proper way we have to call all of this (css, js) from our functions.php page which we haven't created. From next we will do that.

Dynamic properly
=====================================
37. Open twentyseventeen > header.php and copy html start tag code and paste it to out index.html > html tag
                Ex: 
                        before add : <html lang="en">
                        after add  : <html <?php language_attributes(); ?> class="no-js no-svg">
38. Remove first 2 lines of meta description (charset="utf-8", http-equiv="Content-Type" ...).
39. Copy bloginfo('charset') from twentyseventeen > header.php and paste it to our index.php file.
                Ex: 
                        before add : nothing
                        after add  : <meta charset="<?php bloginfo( 'charset' ); ?>">
40. Remove next 4 lines of meta (description, author, keywords, robots). These will dynamic automatically from wordpress.

Dynamic Title tag
=====================================
41. Replace text from title tag by <?php bloginfo('name'); ?>. Now reload our site. We can see the changes of title. Open admin site > Settings > General > Site Title. This is where we get our title.
42. Now add ' | <?php bloginfo('description'); ?>' after title name function tag. Now reload the site. We can see the description also added with the title.
43. Another way is adding add_theme_support('title-tag'); function in our functions.php file. Lets create functions.php file.

44. Create function.php file inside theme > frskynet (our theme name).
45. We will create 2 new php files named header and footer where we put our header and footer. This is because we don't want to duplicate our header and footer code. We will reuse this header, footer. Before that we add some functions inside head and body tag.
                1. Add <?php wp_head(); ?> before head tag ends. By this function we will pass lots of functionality from functions.php to our php files. Ex: css, header title tag, description etc.
                2. Add <?php wp_footer(); ?> before body tag ends. By this we will pass js resources from functions.php to our php files.
46. Go to function and start by <?php from the first line. Now add add_theme_support('title-tag'); function for title tag. Now remove title tag from index.php and reload the site. Notice the title of the site. This is better way than previous.
47. 
48. If we notice that when we added <?php wp_head(); ?> and <?php wp_footer(); ?> we can see an user bar at the top of the site page. If we don't use these function for head, footer it won't come out. Remove <?php wp_head() ?>, <?php wp_footer() ?> from index.php and add_theme_support( 'title-tag' ); from functions.php, the user bar will vanish and we can't see our site title there. Site title will replace by localhost name. So it is important to know about this.

Separate Header and Footer styles and js sources
====================================================
49. For style follow bellow steps -
                1. Create a function like function frskynet_enqueue_style() {}
                2. Use code reference perameter for script - 
                        wp_enqueue_style ($handle, $src, $deps, $version, $media);
                                $handle : css/js file id
                                $src    : source location
                                $deps   : dependencies, type of array()
                                $version: version of code
                                $media  : (optional)
                3. Remove style link from index.
                4. Add style link into function
                        Ex: 
                                index.php :
                                        <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo esc_url(get_template_directory_uri()); ?>/assets/css/main.css">
                                
                                functions.php :
                                        function frskynet_enqueue_style() {
                                                wp_enqueue_style ('main',get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/css/main.css', array(), '1.0');
                                        }
                                        add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'frskynet_enqueue_style');
                5. Reload site page. See there is no changes. The style is now dynamically called by function.
                6. Replace/Change rest of the styles link.
                7. To add our theme style.css just add wp_enqueue_style('style', get_stylesheet_uri()); this inside style function

50. For script follow bellow steps -
                1. Create a function like function frskynet_enqueue_script() {}
                2. Use code reference perameter for script - 
                        wp_enqueue_style ($script-name, $src, $deps, $version, boolean);
                                $script-name : js file id
                                $src    : source location (get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/js/bootstrap-select.min.js')
                                $deps   : dependencies, type of array()
                                $version: version of code
                                boolean  : true/false
                                                if true, this script will add before the body tag ends
                                                if false, this script will add before the head tag ends
                3. Remove js src from index.
                4. Add js link into function
                        Ex: 
                                index.php :
                                        <script src="assets/js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"></script>
                                
                                functions.php :
                                        function frskynet_enqueue_script() {
                                                wp_enqueue_script('jquery', get_template_directory_uri() . '/assets/js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js', array(), 1, true);
                                        }
                                        add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'frskynet_enqueue_script');
                5. Reload site page. See there is no changes. The js is now dynamically called by function.
                6. Replace/Change rest of the js srcs.
                7. To add our theme default jquery, just add wp_enqueue_script('jquery'); at the top of the script function. No need if we add template's js srcs.

Separate Header and Footer into a separate file
=====================================================
51. Create 2 files header.php and footer.php
52. Move from <!Doctype html> to </header> and paste it to our header.php files and move from <footer> to </html> and paste it to our footer.php file.
53. Add <?php get_header();?> on the top of the index.php and <?php get_footer();?> at the bottom of the index.php
54. Now reload the site. It will load our site header and footer from header.php and footer.php dynamically.

Move Left Sidebar to separate php file [Adding/Calling one .php file inside another .php file]
===============================================================================================
55. Create a new php file and named it left-sidebar.php
56. move sidebar content from index.php to left-sidebar.php
57. In index.php file from where we move the sidebar code add <?php get_template_part('left-sidebar'); ?> there. This will call the left-sidebar.php.
58. Now reload the site. It will load our left-sidebar.php dynamically inside index.php file.

Creating Single page
=====================================
59. Create a new php file named page.php
60. Copy all code from blog.php from template and paste it to page.php
61. Remove from <!Doctype html> to </header> and <footer> to </html> from page.php
62. Add <?php get_header();?> on the top of the page.php and <?php get_footer();?> at the bottom of the page.php
63. This will call our header and footer dynamically
64. Now go to wp_admin page > Pages > All Pages and visit 'Sample Page' by clicking view or if you are using private browser or visit by url just paste '/sample-page' after default url. This will take us our sample page or page.php.
65. Notice caerfully. If we load flitmart template blog.html there we can see the images but in our sample-page, there is no images we can see. It didn't load our images.
66. Here we need to add get_template_directory_uri() function before those tags which are using our assets from our asset.
67. Replace these assets by bellow -
                if src is like  => <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/blog-post/blog_big_01.jpg" alt="">
                modify it like  => <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/assets/images/blog-post/blog_big_01.jpg" alt="">
68. If we want to make it secure code put that inside esc_url() function.
                Ex:
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="<?php echo esc_url(get_template_directory_uri()); ?>/assets/images/blog-post/blog_big_01.jpg" alt="">

69. Now reload our site. See ? There all of the images are loaded.
70. Now we are going to make a single post dynamic and remove the rest of the code.
71. Keep a single post and remove/comment all other post.
72. Also remove/comment pagination part. We won't keep it in this file.
73. Reload the site sample-page and see the changes.
74. We will remove image too later. Let's make dynamic the title of the post. Follow the bellow steps -
                1. Remove from <div class="blog-post  wow fadeInUp"> to pagination and paste bellow code there
                        <?php 
                                while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
                                        <div class="blog-post  wow fadeInUp">
                                                <h1>
                                                        <a href="<?php the_permalink();?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a>
                                                </h1>
                                                <?php the_content(); ?>
                                        </div>
			        <?php endwhile;
		        ?>
                2. Reload site page and see the changes. It is fully dynamic now.

75. Now move single page sidebar into a separate php file.
76. Create right-sidebar.php
77. Move sidebar code from page.php to right-sidebar.php
78. Add <?php get_template_part('right-sidebar'); ?> to page.php from where we moved right sidebar code.
79. Reload Page. See no changes. But right sidebar is dynamic and loads from a separate file.

==================================================================================
Till now we just created our custom theme. From now we will work woocommerce.
==================================================================================

Woocommerce setup
=====================================
80. Download Woocommerce from 'https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/'.
81. Go to wp-content > plugin folder and extract woocommerce in this location.
82. Now we will follow woocommerce theme support tutorial 'https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/third-party-custom-theme-compatibility/'.
83. Go to theme > frskynet > functions.php and add following code -
                add_action('after_setup_theme ', 'woocommerce_support');
                function woocommerce_support() {
                        add_theme_support('woocommerce');
                }

84. Now duplicate page.php and rename that woocommerce.php
85. Open woocommerce.php and notice the loop. Delete that part (loop) and place bellow function -
                <?php woocommerce_content(); ?>

86. Now go to wp_admin > Plugin > Installed Plugin, We can see the Woocommerce is present here for activation. If we removed the functionality from function.php for woocommerce theme support and try to activate woocommerce, it will show you a message that will say add woocommerce theme support to your functions.php
87. Now activate woocommerce from wp_admin > Plugin > Installed Plugin.
88. Now we will setup our woocommerce widget configuration.
89. After woocommerce install and setup is done if we notice our database we can see there are 31 new tables are added.

Create First Product
=====================================
90. Now, Let's create our first product. 
                1. Open detail.html from default downloaded flipmart template.
                2. Copy product title, description and go to wp_admin > Product > Add New. Then paste it to title, long description, short description bar.
                3. Now create a category from the right sidebar. Name something. Ex: Fruit.
                4. Add a product image from the right sidebar.
                5. We can add more product image into our gallery. Add more 4 product image to gallery.
                6. Add regular and sell price.
                7. Publish the prouct.

91. Go to wp_admin > Pages > All Pages. We can see there are new pages aded after we installed woocommerce. They are Cart, Checkout, My account, Shop.
92. Open Shop page by clicking view. We can see our product is there which we just created. Now we will design that page as main html page and it's detail page will look like detail.html page.

Design Shop/Category Page
=====================================
93. After adding a product, we can see that style is not fixed for shop page and product single/detail page.
94. Open header.php. Notice body start tag. Remove body class and add body function as <?php body_class(); ?>. It will load woocommerce body style. 
95. Download dummy data. Go to wp_admin > Tools > Import > Wordpress (install)
                # Download Dummy Data from 'https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/tree/master/sample-data'
96. Now click 'Run Importer'. Choose dummy-data.xml file. Upload that. Select admin User and submit.
97. Wait for importing.
98. After Import open wp_admin > Product > All Product. Our dummy products are there. Reload Shop page. We can see the all of the dummy data is there. Now it will be easy to design that page.
99. Also we can see the paging is present.
100. Open woocommerce.php. Before loop, write Hello World in a h1 tag.
                1. Reload Shop page. We can see the Hello World text is there. It comes from woocommerce.php
                2. Click any product. Hello World is present there too.
                # So single product page and shop page both comes from woocommerce.php template.
                # So if sidebar is placed in Shop page at the right and in Product details page it placed in left side, there must be a problem. Read the woocommerce support documentation. There it says that - 'Note: When creating woocommerce.php in your theme’s folder, you will not be able to override the woocommerce/archive-product.php custom template as woocommerce.php has priority over archive-product.php. This is intended to prevent display issues.'
                # This means inside woocommerce > archive.php won't work when we create woocommerce.php.
101. Open woocommerce > template > archive-product.php. Now write 'Hello from woocommerce-product' in a h1 tag before loop starts "woocommerce_product_loop_start()".
102. Now reload Shop page. Shop page means archive-product.php which is inside woocommerce > template. After reloading we can't see the 'Hello from woocommerce-product'. Because frskynet > woocommerce.php is priority high than woocommerce > template.
103. Delete woocommerce.php and reload Shop page. Now we are able to see 'Hello from woocommerce-product' text. We will use woocommerce.php if our Shop page and Detail/Product page will have the same design. That means both page contains sidebar in the left side or right side. In our case, Shop(blog.html) page contains the side bar in it's right and Details/Product (detail.html) page contains the side bar in it's left. So we will use woocommerce template.
104. Woocommerce's default layout loads from woocommerce > template. So if we update something here then it will be overriden. Site win't get the edited layout. So we copy template folder from plugin > woocommerce and paste it to our theme folder and rename this folder 'woocommerce' instead 'template'.
105. Now open archive-product.php from out theme and update that text as 'Hello from our theme template'.
106. Reload Shop page. We can see the changes comes from our theme > woocommerce > archive-product.php
107. If we need to update woocommerce plugins or other plugins, we can update those and our design never get broken as we use it from our theme.
108. Remove text from plugins > woocommerce > template > archive-product.php. Now Lets design Shop page.
                Design Shop Page: 
                        1. Open category.html in a new tab from default template (flipmart). We can see the sidebar is placed in left.
                        2. Now open category.html in editor. Search for 'sidebar'. Notice that, sidebar starts by class 'col-md-3' and contant starts by class 'col-md-9'. There are 3 more divition (div) before these sidebar and content. We will copy from that. [copy from class="body-content outer-top-xs"]
                                Copy bellow code: 
                                        <div class="body-content outer-top-xs">
                                                <div class='container'>
                                                        <div class='row'>
                        3. Open archive-product.php. Paste after get_header() function
                        4. Now before get_footer(), end those div tag. Just 3 times </div>
                        5. There should be error for php start & end tag. Before paste html code close php by '?>' and start php by '<?php'. Inside these paste your html code.
                        6. Now reload Shop page. See the page content got the 'col-md-9'.
                        7. Copy breadcrumb from category.html and paste it in archive-product.php after get_header() before our html code we paste last time.
                        8. Reload Shop page and see the breadcrumb.
                        9. Copy sidebar. It starts by 'col-md-3' and paste it after container > row class.
                        10. Use bellow code or copy from category.html after sidebar code and paste it after sidebar html code in archive-product.php
                                <div class='col-md-9'>
                                        <div class="clearfix filters-container m-t-10"></div>
                                * This time we are not going to copy the banner part.
                        11. This code will end before get_footer(). So ther 2 new </div> will place.
                        12. Reload Shop page and see the sidebar is present.

109. Open project's wp-config.php from root folder and edit WP_DEBUG true. It should be line number 80. Now reload Shop page. You will see an error after the product pagination. It says that - Theme without sidebar.php is deprecated.....
110. Create sidebar.php inside our theme. Reload Shop page. No error there.
111. Open archive-product.php and select code for sidebar. It starts by class="col-md-3 sidebar" and finish before class="col-md-9". Move this code to sidebar and reload SHop page. We can see the sidebar is not present in the left side. It is bellow of the container.
112. Now go to archive-product.php. Search for sidebar code. [do_action('woocommerce_sidebar');?>] Move this function to that place, from where we moved our sidebar html code. Paste it with php start and end tag. Ex: <?php do_action('woocommerce_sidebar');?> ?>. Now Reload Shop page. See there design is fixed. This time Shop page's left sidebar comes from sidebar.php.
113. Now let's design the product in the Shop/Category page.
                3 Products Per Row
                ==============================
                        1. Open Category.html (default/flipmart template) in a new tab.
                        2. Notice that, there are 3 products in a single row but in our wordpress's Shop page's has 4 products in a single row. So we need to modify this that can show 3 products in a single row.
                        3. Seaarch google for 'woocommerce product per row'. Now visit 'Change number of products per row - Woocommerce Docs'. Here you can find how to use custom theme, short code etc. We will use custom theme.
                        4. Copy the custom theme code. Bellow code - 
                                add_filter('loop_shop_columns', 'loop_columns', 999);
                                if (!function_exists('loop_columns')) {
                                        function loop_columns() {
                                                return 3; // 3 products per row
                                        }
                                }
                        5. Paste the code in functions.php.
                        6. Notice, the function return 3. So we will get 3 products in a single row.
                        7. Reload the Shop page. See? There are 3 products in a single row.
                        8. If there need to fix any css then fix that by following bellow - 
                                1. Inspect the product. Clicl the li. li is the product's parent.
                                2. See there should be width at the right side style.
                                3. Width should be 30.75%. If it is not 30.75% then make update it.
                                4. Now you can see the style is fixed in your web page.
                                5. Copy the width.
                                6. Open theme > frskynet > style.css
                                        .woocommerce ul.products.columns-3 li.product, .woocommerce-page ul.products.columns-3 li.product {
                                                width: 30.75%;
                                        }
                                7. You can give a note/comment before that.
                                8. Reload Shop page. See the style is fixed.

                        1. Go to Category.html (default/flipmart template).
                        2. If we move our cursor over the product we can see there are 3 button come over the product. They are "ADD TO CART", "WISH LIST", "COMPARE". First we will make an "Add To Cart" button. Then we see that if we click "Add To Cart" button how it turn into a view cart.
                        3. Go to our theme > woocommerce > loop > add-to-cart.php. The default (SHop page - no design button) "Add To Cart" button comes from this file.

Change "Add To Cart" button text
=================================
114. Google "woocommerce add to cart button text change" and follow Woocommerce Docs - "Change add to cart button text - WooCommerce Docs"
115. Here we can see how to change text in single product, product archive etc.
116. Copy bellow code and paste it to functions.php
                add_filter( 'woocommerce_product_add_to_cart_text', 'custom_woocommerce_product_add_to_cart_text' );

                function custom_woocommerce_product_add_to_cart_text() {
                    global $product;

                    $product_type = $product->get_type();

                    switch ( $product_type ) {
                        case 'external':
                            return __( 'Buy product', 'woocommerce' );
                            break;
                        case 'grouped':
                            return __( 'View product', 'woocommerce' );
                            break;
                        case 'simple':
                            return __( 'Add to cart', 'woocommerce' );
                            break;
                        case 'variable':
                            return __( 'Select option', 'woocommerce' );
                            break;
                        default:
                            return __( 'Read more', 'woocommerce' );
                    }   
                }
117. Reload Shop page. YOu can see the changes when you mouse over any product.

Dynamic Breadcrumb, pagination
=================================
118. To dynamic breadcrumb follow bellow steps - 
                1. Go to archive-product.php, see the breadcrumb is static.
                        <div class="breadcrumb">
                            <div class="container">
                                <div class="breadcrumb-inner">
                                    <ul class="list-inline list-unstyled">
                                        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                                        <li class='active'>Handbags</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                2. Remove ul -
                        <div class="breadcrumb">
                            <div class="container">
                                <div class="breadcrumb-inner">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                3. Replace ul by <?php woocommerce_breadcrumb(); ?> function -
                        <div class="breadcrumb">
                            <div class="container">
                                <div class="breadcrumb-inner">
                                    <?php woocommerce_breadcrumb(); ?>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                4. Reload Shop page and see the breadcrumb is now dynamic.
                5. Problem is category.html page's breadcrumb start using ul,li but our breadcrumb starts by nav tag.
                6. You can fix style by css for nav or search google by "woocommerce breadcrumb". Follow the woocommerce docs and then use "CHange all the things" from documentation.
                7. Copy that code and paste it to functions.php - 
                        add_filter('woocommerce_breadcrumb_defaults', 'frskynet_woocommerce_breadcrumbs');
                        function frskynet_woocommerce_breadcrumbs() {
                            return array(
                                'delimiter' => ' &#47; ',
                                'wrap_before' => '<nav class="woocommerce-breadcrumb" itemprop="breadcrumb">',
                                'wrap_after' => '</nav>',
                                'before' => '',
                                'after' => '',
                                'home' => _x('Home', 'breadcrumb', 'woocommerce'),
                            );
                        }
                8. Function name must be unique.
                9. Notice, the breadcrumb starts by nav tag.
                10. Now modify this by our category.html design. Replace '<nav class="woocommerce-breadcrumb" itemprop="breadcrumb">' by '<div class="breadcrumb-inner"><ul class="list-inline list-unstyled">' in function.
                        function frskynet_woocommerce_breadcrumbs() {
                            return array(
                                'delimiter' => ' &#47; ',
                                'wrap_before' => '<div class="breadcrumb-inner">
                                                        <ul class="list-inline list-unstyled">',
                                'wrap_after' => '</ul>
                                                </div>',
                                'before' => '',
                                'after' => '',
                                'home' => _x('Home', 'breadcrumb', 'woocommerce'),
                            );
                        }
                11. Remove div [class="breadcrumb-inner"] from archive-product.php.
                12. Reload Shop page and see the breadcrumb looks like default template (category.html) html code structure.
                13. We can change Home text if we modify last return perameter of that function's first variable "Home".
                14. We can also change the '/' of breadcrumb separator by modifying delimiter of the function. Use '-' for testing or you can use anything.

119. Remove breadcrumb from top of the products category section.
                1. Go to the last woocommerce documentation for breadcrumb and follow the 'Remove the breadcrumbs'. Copy remove breadcrumb function and paste it to functions.php
                        add_action( 'init', 'frskynet_remove_wc_breadcrumbs' );
                        function frskynet_remove_wc_breadcrumbs() {
                                remove_action( 'woocommerce_before_main_content', 'woocommerce_breadcrumb', 20, 0 );
                        }
                2. Function name must be unique.
                3. Now google 'woocommerce shop page vitual layout' and visit 'https://www.businessbloomer.com/woocommerce-visual-hook-guide-archiveshopcat-page/'
                4. Copy 'woocommerce_before_main_content' from function and search it in that page.
                5. Notice the first result. We need to remove this.
                6. Now go to archive-product.php and search for 'woocommerce_before_main_content'. Here we can see there are 2 items. They are 'woocommerce_breadcrumb - 20' and 'woocommerce_output_content_wrapper - 10' (in the comment).
                7. We want to remove 'woocommerce_breadcrumb - 20'.
                8. Notice 
                        remove_action( 'woocommerce_before_main_content', 'woocommerce_breadcrumb', 20, 0 );
                        Here it says that we are going to remove 'woocommerce_breadcrumb - 20'. The 3rd and 4th perameter is the position and priority (before/after).
                9. Reload Shop page. We can see the breadcrumb is gone for that section.

120. Remove Title from top of the products category section. (Shop)
                1. Open archive-product.php and notice the header.
                        <?php if (apply_filters('woocommerce_show_page_title', true)): ?>
                2. apply_filters() function's 2nd perameter is true. 
                3. Make it false and Reload the Shop page. You can see the changes.
121. Remove 'Showing Result' from top of the products category section. (Shop)
                1. visit 'https://www.businessbloomer.com/woocommerce-visual-hook-guide-archiveshopcat-page/'
                2. Notice the hook before the Showing result. (3rd one) [woocommerce_before_shop_loop]
                3. Search 'woocommerce_before_shop_loop' in archive-product.php
                4. Here we can see there are 3 items. The last 2 items are 'woocommerce_result_count - 20' and 'woocommerce_catalog_ordering - 30' (in the comment).
                5. But we have only 'woocommerce_catalog_ordering - 30' in category.html but 'woocommerce_result_count - 20' is not there.
                6. Copy the last function and modify libe bellow
                        add_action( 'init', 'frskynet_remove_woocommerce_result_count' );
                        function frskynet_remove_woocommerce_result_count() {
                                remove_action( 'woocommerce_before_shop_loop', 'woocommerce_result_count', 20, 0 );
                        }
                7. Paste it to functions.php
                8. Reload the Shop page. See the changes.

122. Remove default catelog ordering from top of the products category section. (Shop)
                1. At first notice the left side of product category section. It is default ordering. Remove this default ordering.
                2. Copy removing item function's code and paste it the functions.php
                3. Search 'woocommerce_before_shop_loop' in archive-product.php
                4. We are going to remove 'woocommerce_catalog_ordering - 30' item.
                5. Modify code like bellow
                        add_action( 'init', 'frskynet_remove_woocommerce_catelog_ordering' );
                        function frskynet_remove_woocommerce_catelog_ordering() {
                                remove_action( 'woocommerce_before_shop_loop', 'woocommerce_catalog_ordering', 30, 0 );
                        }
                6. Notice the remove_action() function, 2nd perameter is the name of item what we want to remove and the 3rd perameter is the number of that item which declear in archive-product.php
                7. Reload Shop page. See there is no default catelog ordering anymore.

Dynamic Pagination
====================
123. Pagination - Grid/List, Sorting by position, Show product, paging
                1. Open category.html and notice the ordering section by inspect element (grid, list ....)
                2. It is under the class="clearfix filters-container m-t-10" section. And then product looping class="search-result-container".
                3. Now notice our project's Shop pages loop section. We already have class="clearfix filters-container m-t-10" section.
                4. Open archive-product.php. There we can find the loop for product. 
                        woocommerce_product_loop_start();
                5. Before this loop, we can find a divition (div) class="clearfix filters-container m-t-10" which is under another divition (div) class="col-md-9". We already have it.
                6. We need a row after the divition (div) class="clearfix filters-container m-t-10" and inside the row we need a column.
                7. Go after do_action('woocommerce_before_shop_loop'); and before woocommerce_product_loop_start();
                8. Create a divition (div) and class="row".
                9. Create 4 divition (div) and class="col-md-3" inside the row divition (div).
                        <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-md-3">Col 1</div>
                                <div class="col-md-3">Col 2</div>
                                <div class="col-md-3">Col 3</div>
                                <div class="col-md-3">Col 4</div>
                        </div>
                10. Reload Shop page. We have the row with 4 column.
                11. Pagination - 
                        1. Inspect category.html pagination. It developed by ul, li and this ul,li is under a divition (div) class="pagination-container".
                        2. So if we add the same divition (div) class="pagination-container" before our pagination we will get the same style as category.html.
                        3. We can do this by js or custom php. But custom php is better than js. (In this case).
                        4. Google 'wordpress pagination with custom class' then visit 'https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/126080/changing-pagination-list-class'
                        5. Copy bellow code from the site - 
                                function bittersweet_pagination() {
                                    global $wp_query;
                                    if ($wp_query->max_num_pages <= 1) {
                                        return;
                                    }
                                    $big = 999999999; // need an unlikely integer
                                    $pages = paginate_links(array(
                                        'base' => str_replace($big, '%#%', esc_url(get_pagenum_link($big))),
                                        'format' => '?paged=%#%',
                                        'current' => max(1, get_query_var('paged')),
                                        'total' => $wp_query->max_num_pages,
                                        'type' => 'array',
                                    ));
                                    if (is_array($pages)) {
                                        $paged = (get_query_var('paged') == 0) ? 1 : get_query_var('paged');
                                        echo '<div class="pagination-wrap"><ul class="pagination">';
                                        foreach ($pages as $page) {
                                            echo "<li>$page</li>";
                                        }
                                        echo '</ul></div>';
                                    }
                                }
                        6. Paste it to functions.php
                        7. Rename the function as flipmart_pagination.
                        8. Notice carefullt. What is done here ? Here we use paginate_links ans using this we are passing some perameters. We can pass more perameters by this.
                        9. In the 2nd condition's first echo - we can place our custom class here. Modify this echo like bellow - 
                                echo '<div class="pagination-container"><ul class="list-inline list-unstyled">';
                        10. Now go to archive-product.php and go to the row we created with 4 columns.
                        11. Replace 'Col 4' by the pagination function name.
                                before: <div class="col-md-3">Col 4</div>
                                after : <div class="col-md-3"><?php flipmart_pagination(); ?></div>
                        12. Reload Shop page. We can see the pagination here.
                        13. If we inspect the Shop page's pagination we can see the '<div class="pagination-wrap"><ul class="pagination">' - these div and ul are added by the paginaation function.
                        14. Notice there next text come instead the arrow button (previous, next arrow button).
                        15. Google 'paginate_links' and visit 'https://wpseek.com/function/paginate_links/' or 'https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/paginate_links/'
                        16 There we can see the peremeters which can pass by this function.
                        17. From there we take 3 perameter.
                                'prev_next'          => true,
                                'prev_text'          => __( '&laquo; Previous' ),
                                'next_text'          => __( 'Next &raquo;' ),
                        18. Now paste it after the other perameters. Now it looks like bellow - 
                                $pages = paginate_links(array(
                                    'base' => str_replace($big, '%#%', esc_url(get_pagenum_link($big))),
                                    'format' => '?paged=%#%',
                                    'current' => max(1, get_query_var('paged')),
                                    'total' => $wp_query->max_num_pages,
                                    'type' => 'array',
                                    'prev_next' => true,
                                    'prev_text' => __( '&laquo; Previous' ),
                                    'next_text' => __( 'Next &raquo;' ),
                                ));
                        19. If we make false for 'prev_next', button won't show. '&laquo; Previous' means for previous we can see the previous arrow with 'Previous' text. 'Next &raquo;' means for previous we can see the next arrow with 'Next' text. 
                        20. Remove Previous and Next text from there.
                                'prev_text' => __( '&laquo;' ),
                                'next_text' => __( '&raquo;' ),
                        21. Reload the page. See there is no next or previous text. Only arrow.
                        22. Still we have not the same style. Google 'font awsome next arrow' and get right arrow code.
                                <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                        23. Paste that code for both os the peremeters. Modify the previous like bellow
                                <i class="fa fa-arrow-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                        24. code should looks like bellow - 
                                'prev_text' => __( '<i class="fa fa-arrow-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>' ),
                                'next_text' => __( '<i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>' ),
                        25. Reload Shop page. See the arrow. This time arrow doesn't match.
                        26. Copy from category.html font awsome arrows and paste it to paginate_links() function's perameter value.
                        27. Code should looks like bellow - 
                                'prev_text' => __( '<i class="fa fa-angle-left"></i>' ),
                                'next_text' => __( '<i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i>' ),
                        28. Reload Shop page. See the arrow. Almost same.
                        29. Pick the class="pagination-container" and add following style to style.css - 
                                .pagination-container {
                                    float: right;
                                }
                                .pagination-container ul li a.next.page-numbers,
                                .pagination-container ul li a.prev.page-numbers {
                                    background: #ccc none repeat scroll 0 0;
                                    color: #fff;
                                    padding: 0 9px;
                                    border-radius: 4px;
                                }
                                .pagination-container ul li:hover a.next.page-numbers,
                                .pagination-container ul li:hover a.prev.page-numbers {
                                    background: #333;
                                }
                        30. Reload Shop page. See the changes.
                        31. Now notice the Shop page bottom pagination. Let's remove this.
                                1. Go to archive-product.php and Look for do_action('woocommerce_after_shop_loop'); function after  woocommerce_product_loop_end(); function.
                                2. There is a 'woocommerce_pagination - 10' already set by default.
                                3. We remove this by functions.php
                                4. Copy a remove function and paste it bellow.
                                5. We will remove this pagination 'woocommerce_pagination - 10' under 'woocommerce_after_shop_loop' and the 3rd perameter is 10 which is priority.
                                6. Reload Shop Page. See there is no paginaation at the bottom.
                        32. Place our pagination at the bottom.
                                1. Copy our pagination function '<?php flipmart_pagination(); ?>' code from the class="col-md-3" and paste it after do_action('woocommerce_after_shop_loop');
                                2.Reload Shop Page. See our custom pagination is there.
                        
                12. Show product per page - 
                        1. Google 'woocommerce product show per page dropdown' and visit 'https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/96731/woocommerce-products-per-page-dropdown' or copy bellow code -
                                remove_action('woocommerce_before_shop_loop', 'woocommerce_catalog_ordering', 30);
                                function woocommerce_catalog_page_ordering() {
                                ?>
                                <?php echo '<span class="itemsorder">Items Per Page:'?>
                                <form action="" method="POST" name="results" class="woocommerce-ordering">
                                        <select name="woocommerce-sort-by-columns" id="woocommerce-sort-by-columns" class="sortby" onchange="this.form.submit()">
                                        <?php 
                                        // Get product on page reload
                                        if( isset($_POST['woocommerce-sort-by-columns']) && (($_COOKIE['shop_pageResults']<> $_POST['woocommerce-sort-by-columns'])) ) {
                                        $numberOfProductPerPage = $_POST['woocommerce-sort-by-columns'];
                                        } else {
                                        $numberOfProductPerPage = $_POST['shop_pageResults'];
                                        }

                                        // This is where you can change the amount per page that the user will use feel free to change the number of products
                                        $shopCatalog_orderby = apply_filters('woocommerce_sortby_page', array(
                                        // Add as many of these as you want to, -1 shows all products per page
                                        // '' => __('Result per page', 'woocommerce'),
                                        '20' => __('20', 'woocommerce'),
                                        '-1' => __('All', 'woocommerce'),
                                        ));
                                        foreach( $shopCatalog_orderby as $shop_id => $sort_name )
                                        echo '<option value="' . $sort_id . '" ' . selected( $numberOfProductsPerPage, $sort_id, true) . ' >' . $sort_name . '</option>';
                                        ?>
                                        </select>
                                </form>
                                <?php echo '</span>' ?>
                                <?php    
                                }

                                // Now we set our cookie of we need to
                                function dl_sort_by_page($count) {
                                if( $isset($_COOKIE['shop_pageResults']) ) { // if normal page load with cookie
                                        $count = $_COOKIE['shop_pageResults'];
                                }
                                if($isset( $_POST['woocommerce-sort-by-columns'])) { //if form submitted
                                        setcookie('shop_pageResults', $_POST['woocommerce-sort-by-columns'], time()+1209600, '/', 'www.your-domain-goes-here.com', false);
                                        $count = $_POST['woocommerce-sort-by-columns'];
                                }
                                // else normal page load and no cookie
                                return $count;
                                }
                                add_filter('loop_shop_per_page', 'dl_sort_by_page');
                                add_action('woocommerce_before_shop_loop', 'woocommerce_catalog_page_ordering', 20);

                        
                        2. Paste this code in functions.php and reload Shop page. We can see there there is a option show per page placed over the row. But now we want to set this showing result inside 3rd column of pagination row.
                                before: <div class="col-md-3">Col 3</div>
                                after : <div class="col-md-3"><?php frskynet_woocommerce_catalog_page_ordering(); ?></div>
                        3. Notice the add_action() - last line of the code we paste
                                add_action('woocommerce_before_shop_loop', 'woocommerce_catalog_page_ordering', 20);
                        4. This means 'woocommerce_catalog_page_ordering' is added under the 'woocommerce_before_shop_loop'.
                        5. Remove add_action('woocommerce_before_shop_loop', 'woocommerce_catalog_page_ordering', 20);
                        6. Rename the function as frskynet_woocommerce_catalog_page_ordering() and add the function inside class="col-md-3" in archive-product.php row-columns (3rd one).
                        7. Notice one more thing. 1st line od our pasted code - 
                                remove_action('woocommerce_before_shop_loop', 'woocommerce_catalog_ordering', 30);
                        8. We already added/said this before. So now de don't need this any more. Remove this line from functions.php.
                        9. Reload Shop page. Our show per page is in the 3rd column of pagination row.
                        10. Notice that in Shop page it says 'Items per page' but in category.html it is 'Show'. So go to our function's first span. Replace 'Items per page' by 'Shop' and reload Shop page. Text should be changed.
                        11. Inspect the Show text from category.html, copy the class name and paste it to span. And also close the span right there then remove the bellow span close tag. Now Reload Shop page. Still we haven't get the style.
                        12. See the category.html and notice the Show span. There is another divition over this span. So this Show span is under that divition (div).
                        13. Create a divition (div) over the span in functions.php and set class="lbl-cnt" then close it after form close.
                        14. Replace form's class="fld inline" instead of class="woocommerce-ordering". Now Reload Shop page.
                        15. Fix the style by css or add the following code in style.css.
                                select#woocommerce-sort-by-columns {
                                    padding: 4px 12px;
                                    border: 1px solid #ddd;
                                }
                        16. Now add the distance of products showing number. We can edit this in apply_filters() function. Follow bellow code - 
                                $shopCatalog_orderby = apply_filters('woocommerce_sortby_page', array(
                                        '3' => __('3', 'flipmart'),
                                        '6' => __('6', 'flipmart'),
                                        '9' => __('9', 'flipmart'),
                                        '12' => __('12', 'flipmart'),
                                        '15' => __('15', 'flipmart'),
                                        '-1' => __('All', 'flipmart'),
                                ));
                        17. Here left side number is the value and right side's first perameter is the showing result and second one is text domain.
                        18. Reload Shop page. Our option is there.
                        19. Now go to wp_admin > Settings > Reading and set Blog pages show at most 6 and reload the Shop page again.

                13. Sort by position - 
                        1. We already removed this option. Notice bellow code - 
                                add_action('init', 'frskynet_remove_woocommerce_catelog_ordering');
                                function frskynet_remove_woocommerce_catelog_ordering() {
                                    remove_action('woocommerce_before_shop_loop', 'woocommerce_catalog_ordering', 30, 0);
                                }
                        2. Now go to archive-product.php and notice the removed function's name 'woocommerce_catalog_ordering' before our row,columns started which is also placed before do_action('woocommerce_before_shop_loop') function.
                        3. So we are going to use that function (woocommerce_catalog_ordering) inside our 2nd column.
                                before: <div class="col-md-3">Col 2</div>
                                after : <div class="col-md-3"><?php woocommerce_catalog_ordering(); ?></div>
                        4. Reload Shop page. See there is our sort option is present in 2nd column.
                        5. After this we can see the difference between our Shop page and the category.html. There is no similarity in between them. We need to customized it.
                        6. We can edit this from plugins > woocommerce > includes > wc-template-functions.php file. But we don't want to touch plugin files as we want to customized it by ourself and when we will get any updates our site never get broken.
                        7. Google 'custom woocommerce sorting option' and visit 'https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/custom-sorting-options-ascdesc/' then copy bellow code - 
                                add_filter( 'woocommerce_get_catalog_ordering_args', 'custom_woocommerce_get_catalog_ordering_args' );
                                function custom_woocommerce_get_catalog_ordering_args( $args ) {
                                        $orderby_value = isset( $_GET['orderby'] ) ? wc_clean( $_GET['orderby'] ) : apply_filters( 'woocommerce_default_catalog_orderby', get_option( 'woocommerce_default_catalog_orderby' ) );
                                        if ( 'random_list' == $orderby_value ) {
                                                $args['orderby'] = 'rand';
                                                $args['order'] = '';
                                                $args['meta_key'] = '';
                                        }
                                        return $args;
                                }
                                add_filter( 'woocommerce_default_catalog_orderby_options', 'custom_woocommerce_catalog_orderby' );
                                add_filter( 'woocommerce_catalog_orderby', 'custom_woocommerce_catalog_orderby' );
                                function custom_woocommerce_catalog_orderby( $sortby ) {
                                        $sortby['random_list'] = 'Random';
                                        return $sortby;
                                }

                        8. Now paste this code to our functions.php.
                        9. See, there are 2 functions. First one is if we want to pass any argument and the second one is if we want to change the texts in the sorting box in html.
                        10. So we can remove the first function and keep the second one. Rename the function. Then give a text in the first line inside the function. Replace 'Random' by 'Test Random'. Then reload the Shop page.
                                add_filter( 'woocommerce_catalog_orderby', 'frskynet_custom_woocommerce_catalog_orderby' );
                                function frskynet_custom_woocommerce_catalog_orderby( $sortby ) {
                                        $sortby['random_list'] = 'Test Random';
                                        return $sortby;
                                }

                        11. We can see our Test Randon text is in the sorting box. Now we need to design by category.html
                        12. Copy sort order array items from plugins > woocommerce > includes > wc-template-functions.php file. See bellow code - 
                                $catalog_orderby_options = apply_filters('woocommerce_catalog_orderby', 
                                    array(
                                        'menu_order' => __( 'Default sorting', 'woocommerce' ),
                                        'popularity' => __( 'Sort by popularity', 'woocommerce' ),
                                        'rating'     => __( 'Sort by average rating', 'woocommerce' ),
                                        'date'       => __( 'Sort by latest', 'woocommerce' ),
                                        'price'      => __( 'Sort by price: low to high', 'woocommerce' ),
                                        'price-desc' => __( 'Sort by price: high to low', 'woocommerce' ),
                                    )
                                );

                        13. Update our function as bellow - 
                                $sortby['menu_order']  = 'Position';
                                $sortby['price']       = 'Price:Lowest first';
                                $sortby['price-desc'] = 'Price:Highest first';
                                $sortby['menu_order'] = 'Product Name:A to Z';

                        14. As menu_order comes 2 times, remove the last one.
                                $sortby['menu_order']  = 'Position';
                                $sortby['price']       = 'Price:Lowest first';
                                $sortby['price-desc'] = 'Price:Highest first';

                        15. Reloas Shop page. We can see the updates and there is also some other option is present which come from plugins > woocommerce > includes > wc-template-functions.php file. We need to unset all of those. Update function like bellow - 
                                $sortby['menu_order']  = 'Position';
                                $sortby['price']       = 'Price:Lowest first';
                                $sortby['price-desc'] = 'Price:Highest first';
                                unset($sortby['popularity']);
                                unset($sortby['date']);
                                unset($sortby['rating']);
                        
                        16. Reloas Shop page. See there is no other option.
                        17. Now we need to add the 'Sort by' text before sortion box. Inside class="col-md-3" (second column) update code like bellow - 
                                before: <div class="col-md-3"><?php woocommerce_catalog_ordering() ?></div>
                                after : 
                                        <div class="col-md-3">
                                            <div class="lbl-cnt">
                                                <span class="lbl">Sort by</span>
                                                <div class="fld inline">
                                                    <?php woocommerce_catalog_ordering() ?>
                                                </div>
                                            </div>
                                        </div>

                        18. Fix the style - 
                                select.orderby {
                                        padding: 4px 12px;
                                        font-size: 13px;
                                        border: 1px solid #e5e5e5;
                                }

                        19. Reload and see the changes. This section's width is too large. So in row's first column's class update as col-md-2 and the 2nd one is col-md-4.
                        20. Now reload and see the changes.

                14. Dynamic Grid/List view - 
                        1. Google 'Grid & List Toggle for Woocommerce' and visit 'https://wordpress.org/plugins/grid-list-toggle-for-woocommerce' or 'https://wpdownloadfree.com/woocommerce-grid-list-toggle-download-free-wordpress-plugin'. Download the plugin (2nd one). Then move the plugin in wp-content > plugins folder.
                        2. Now go to wp_admin > Plugins > Install Plugin and Activate the plugin. Then reload Shop page. We can see the grid/list icon over the pagination row. But we want it inside our 1st column. Right now it comes from plugins. That means hook 'woocommerce_before_shop_loop' echo this grid/list item under itself.
                        3. Inspect the grid/list. Copy the markup code - 

                                1st plugin (Grid & List toggle for Woocommerce - 1st link)
                                -------------------------------------------------------------
                                <nav class="phoen_gridlist_toggle">
                                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="phoen_grid" class="phoen_grid" title="Grid view"><span class="dashicons dashicons-grid-view"></span> </a>
                                        <a href="javascript:void(0);" id="phoen_list" class="phoen_list active" title="List view"><span class="dashicons dashicons-exerpt-view"></span></a>
                                </nav>

                                2nd plugin (WooCommerce Grid / List toggle - 2nd link - recommended)
                                ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                <nav class="gridlist-toggle">
                                    <a href="#" id="grid" title="Grid view" class="active">
                                        <span class="dashicons dashicons-grid-view"></span>
                                        <em>Grid view</em>
                                    </a>
                                    <a href="#" id="list" title="List view">
                                        <span class="dashicons dashicons-exerpt-view"></span>
                                        <em>List view</em>
                                    </a>
                                </nav>

                        4. Paste this code inside pagination row's first column (col-md-2). Reload page. See the grid/list icon inside our first column. And it works properly or it will work when we remove the 1st one (default grid/list icon).
                        5. But there are another one over the pagination row. We need to remove this one.
                        6. Open wp-content > plugins > grid-list-toggle-for-woocommerce > woocommerce_grid_list.php (1st link plugin) or wp-content > plugins > woocommerce-grid-list-toggle > woocommerce-grid-list-toggle.php (2nd link plugin) and search for 'woocommerce_before_shop_loop' (1st and 2nd both link plugin). There is a function which enable this grid/list section.
                                
                                1st plugin (Grid & List toggle for Woocommerce - 1st link)
                                -------------------------------------------------------------
                                add_action( 'woocommerce_before_shop_loop', 'phoen_grid_list_toggle_button',35);

                                2nd plugin (WooCommerce Grid / List toggle - 2nd link - recommended)
                                ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                add_action( 'woocommerce_before_shop_loop', array( $this, 'gridlist_toggle_button' ), 30);

                        7. We need to remove this from functions.php
                        8. Copy a remove function and past it bottom of the functions.php and modify like bellow - 

                                1st plugin (Grid & List toggle for Woocommerce - 1st link)
                                -------------------------------------------------------------
                                add_action('init', 'frskynet_remove_gridlist_plugin_option');
                                function frskynet_remove_gridlist_plugin_option() {
                                    remove_action('woocommerce_before_shop_loop', 'phoen_grid_list_toggle_button', 35, 0);
                                }

                                2nd plugin (WooCommerce Grid / List toggle - 2nd link - recommended)
                                ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                add_action('init', 'frskynet_remove_gridlist_plugin_option');
                                function frskynet_remove_gridlist_plugin_option() {
                                    remove_action('woocommerce_before_shop_loop', 'gridlist_toggle_button', 30, 0);
                                }

                                if function doesn't work follow this - 
                                ----------------------------------------
                                function frskynet_remove_gridlist_plugin_option() {
                                        global $WC_List_Grid;
                                        remove_action('woocommerce_before_shop_loop', array($WC_List_Grid, 'gridlist_toggle_button'), 30);
                                }
                                add_action('woocommerce_archive_description', 'frskynet_remove_gridlist_plugin_option');

                        9. Reload the page. Default gridlist is removed.
                        10. There are some difference in between category.html and our site. Category.html 's gridlist start by ul,li and our's nav. you can fix that by using css.
                                1st link - 
                                span.dashicons.dashicons-grid-view,
                                span.dashicons.dashicons-list-view {
                                        font-size: 18px;
                                }

                                2nd link - 
                                .gridlist-toggle .dashicons:before, .gridlist-toggle .dashicons {
                                        font-size: 18px;
                                }
                        
                        11. For 2nd link plugin we need to fix some html code like category.html. Copy code from category.html and modify like bellow -
                                <ul id="filter-tabs" class="phoen_gridlist_toggle nav nav-tabs nav-tab-box nav-tab-fa-icon">
                                    <li class="active">
                                        <a href="#" id="grid" title="Grid view"><i class="icon fa fa-th-large"></i>Grid</a>
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="">
                                        <a href="#" id="list" title="List view"><i class="icon fa fa-th-list"></i>List</a>
                                    </li>
                                </ul> 

                        12. Reload the page. See the similarity.
                        13. To set Grid/List view default go to wp_admin > woocommerce > Settings > Product (tab) > Display  > Default catelog view > Grid/List. For this we have to activate our plugin.

Dynamic Sidebar
============================
124. Now we are going to dynamic our left sidebar in Shop/Category page
                1. Notice that, at first we have CATEGORIES (sidebar first text). We will dynamic this later when we make dynamic our menus. At this time we register our sidebar and put some default widgets.
                2. Open our theme > sidebar.php. See the menu part which class start by class="side-menu animate-dropdown outer-bottom-xs" and end before class="sidebar-module-container". Remove the whole menu section. We can dynamic this part by widget.
                3. Then notice the repeated part. class="sidebar-widget wow fadeInUp animated" is repeated again and again.
                4. Google 'wp sidebar register' and visit 'https://codex.wordpress.org/Sidebars' 
                5. Copy bellow code and paste it to functions.php - 
                        add_action('widgets_init', 'theme_slug_widgets_init');
                        function theme_slug_widgets_init() {
                            register_sidebar( array(
                                'name'         => __('Main Sidebar', 'theme-slug'),
                                'id'           => 'sidebar-1',
                                'description'  => __('widgets  in this area  will be shown on  all posts and pages', 'theme-slug'),
                                'before_widget'=> __('<li id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">'),
                                'after_widget' => __('</li>'),
                                'before_title' => __('<h2 class=""widgettitle>'),
                                'after_title'  => __('</h2>'),
                            ) );
                        }
                6. Modify as bellow - 
                        add_action('widgets_init', 'theme_slug_widgets_init');
                        function theme_slug_widgets_init() {
                            register_sidebar( array(
                                'name'         => __('Left Sidebar', 'theme-slug'),
                                'id'           => 'left_sidebar',
                                'description'  => __('widgets  in this area  will be shown on  all posts and pages', 'theme-slug'),
                                'before_widget'=> __('<div class="sidebar-widget wow fadeInUp animated" style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;">'),
                                'after_widget' => __('</div>'),
                                'before_title' => __('<h3 class="section-title">'),
                                'after_title'  => __('</h3>'),
                            ) );
                        }
                7. Here name, id is the sidebar name and id. Description is as your wish. 
                        'before_widget' -> It is the repeated part start divition (div)
                        'after_widget'  -> It is the repeated part end divition (div)
                        'before_title'  -> Sidebar title start tag
                        'after_title'   -> Sidebar title end tag
                8. Now remove all of the repeated code from sidebar.php inside class="sidebar-filter". Now we will get almost blank file. It (sidebar.php) looks like - 
                        <div class="col-md-3 sidebar">
                            <div class="sidebar-module-container">
                                <div class="sidebar-filter">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                9. Add dynamic sidebar id (left_sidebar) inside class="sidebar-filter by using <?php dynamic_sidebar(); ?> - 
                        <div class="col-md-3 sidebar">
                            <div class="sidebar-module-container">
                                <div class="sidebar-filter">
                                    <?php dynamic_sidebar('left_sidebar'); ?>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                10. Change theme-slag by Text Domain (flipmart).
                11. Reload wp_admin and you can see the Widgets option inside Appearence. Before that it was not there.
                12. Go to wp_admin > Appearance > Widgets and add some widgets there - 
                        1. Products
                        2. Recent Product Review.
                13. Reload Shop page. 

125. Price Slider
                1. In category.html there is a sidebar section named "Price Slider'. If we want to make it dynamic as widget then we have a free plugin.
                2. Google 'wc ajax product filter' then visit 'https://wordpress.org/plugins/wc-ajax-product-filter/'
                3. We can use this plugin to dynamic price slider.

Single Product Page Dynamic
===============================
126. Open detail.html from default template in an editor.
127. From our Shop page, click any product to visit single product or product detail page. We need to design this page.
128. Before this design open wp-content > plugins > woocommerce > template in a tab and open wp-content > theme > frskynet > woocommerce in another tab.
129. We can see the same files are there in both follow. We copied wp-content > plugins > woocommerce > template folder and pasted wp-content > theme > frskynet and renamed it as woocommerce. Because we need to make our theme > woocommerce files updateable/editable and make this priority high than plugin. So if there need to update plugins our design never get broken.
130. Now go to wp_admin > Woocommerce > System Status. Notice the bottom site 'Templates' which says Override(WooCommerce). 
131. Here we can see status of those files which were overriden woocommerce plugin. That means we had overriden all of the template files. But we won't need to override all of those because we will modified some files instead of all of those files.
132. So we will keep those files which we want to modify and delete the rest of the files.
133. We can do this override by child theme. (See the upper section)
134. So we are going to delete those files which we haven't touched or modified. We only worked in archive-product.php and loop folder > add-to-cart.php files.
135. Keeping these 2 files delete all of those files from our theme > woocommerce.
136. Now check our site. It should works properly.
137. Now go to wp_admin > Woocommerce > System Status. Now it says that we overriden only 2 files. It is not a good idea to override all of the files from plugin and sometimes you have to update woocommerce. Then you need to fix lots of bugs.
138. Lets design our single product page.
139. Now open wp-content > plugins > woocommerce > template. There is a file named single-product.php. Copy this and paste it to our theme > woocommerce. Open it in editor and see the construction.
140. Design - 
                1. Open theme > woocommerce > archive-product.php and copy the breadcrumb section with container row section - 
                        <div class="breadcrumb">
                            <div class="container">
                                <?php woocommerce_breadcrumb(); ?>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="body-content outer-top-xs">
	                    <div class='container'>
		                <div class='row'>
                2. Paste it theme > woocommerce > single-product.php after the get_header() function.
                3. Move woocommerce sidebar from the bottom of single-product.php and place it after row container we pasted last.
                        <?php
                                /**
                                * woocommerce_sidebar hook.
                                *
                                * @hooked woocommerce_get_sidebar - 10
                                */
                                do_action( 'woocommerce_sidebar' );
                        ?>
                4. After sidebar paste bellow code. It comes from archive-product.php
		        <div class='col-md-9'>
			    <div class="clearfix filters-container m-t-10">
                5. Now close those divition (div) before get_footer() function as archive-product.php. There are 5 divitions (div)
                                        </div>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                6. Reload Single page. See ? Our layout os fixed.
                7. Add 'single-product' class with row class. In our single page row has this class which is not in archive-product.php.
                8. Fix some style - 
                        .woocommerce #content div.product div.images, .woocommerce div.product div.images, .woocommerce-page #content div.product div.images, .woocommerce-page div.product div.images {
                                width: 38%;
                        }
                        .woocommerce #content div.product div.summary, .woocommerce div.product div.summary, .woocommerce-page #content div.product div.summary, .woocommerce-page div.product div.summary {
                                width: 58%;
                        }
                        .woocommerce div.product div.images img {
                                border: 1px solid #ddd;
                        }
                9. Dynamic gallery image (Carousel) - 
                        1. Add some image for it.
                                1. Go to wp_admin > Product > Select your product (Edit) > Add product gallery image > Update.
                        2. See the images are not look like carousel. We need to design like detail.html product gallery (owl carousel).
                        3. Open our theme > assets > js > script.js in editor. In this file we have all of our theme activation functionality.
                        4. Search for 'SINGLE PRODUCT GALLERY' comment title. The first activation function is for 'items: 1' and the second function is for 'items: 4'. Let's see which one we need.
                        5. Inspect product image from detail.html and copy full owl-carousel html markup from there. It should be start by class='single-product-gallery-thumbs gallery-thumbs'. Now paste it to notepad++ new tab.
                        6. Select Language > H > HTML from the menu of notepad++. Pasted markup code should be looks like html.
                        7. Copy 'items: 4' selector from script.js (owl-single-product-thumbnails) and search notepad++ for it.
                        8. Notice the repeated part of owl-carousel. It should be start by class="owl-item".
                        9. See the activation selector in notepad++ (owl-single-product-thumbnails). If we placed it to script.js from where it echo the gallery images then our work is done.
                        10. Now go to wp-content > plugins > woocommerce > template. See there is a folder named 'single-product'. In this folder there are 2 files. They are product-image.php which is for our product image (big image) and product-thumbnails.php which is for showing our gallery images.
                        11. Copy single-product folder from wp-content > plugins > woocommerce > template and paste it to our theme > woocommerce.
                        12. Now open this folder from our theme > woocommerce. There we only work in product-thumbnails.php. So keeping this file remove the rest of the files and folders. Open this file in editor.
                        13. It looks like new version. Comment all of the code from 'defined( 'ABSPATH' ) || exit' to bottom. Now edit the file like bellow - 
                                

                                if ( !defined( 'ABSPATH' )) {
                                    exit;
                                }

                                global $post, $product, $woocommerce;

                                $attachment_ids = $product->get_gallery_image_ids();

                                if($attachment_ids) {
                                    $loop    = 0;
                                    $columns = apply_filters('woocommerce_product_thumbnails_columns', 3);
                                    ?>
                                    <div class="thumbnails <?php echo 'columns-' . $columns; ?>"><?php
                                        foreach( $attachment_ids as $attachment_id ) {
                                            $classes  = array( 'zoom' );

                                            if($loop === 0 || $loop % $columns === 0) {
                                                $classes[] = 'first';
                                            }
                                                        
                                            if( ( $loop + 1 ) % $columns === 0) {
                                                $classes[] = 'last';
                                            }

                                            $image_class = implode('', $classes);
                                            $props       = wc_get_product_attachment_props( $attachment_id, $post );

                                            if( !$props['url'] ) {
                                                continue;
                                            }

                                            echo apply_filters(
                                                'woocommerce_single_product_image_thumbnail_html',
                                                sprintf(
                                                    '<a href="%s" class="%s" title="%s" data-rel="prettyPhoto[product-gallery]">%s</a>',
                                                    esc_url( $props['url'] ),
                                                    esc_attr( $image_class ),
                                                    esc_attr( $props['caption'] ),
                                                    wp_get_attachment_image( $attachment_id, apply_filters(
                                                        'single_product_small_thumbnail_size', 'shop_thumbnail'), 0, $props
                                                    )
                                                ),
                                                $attachment_id,
                                                $post->ID,
                                                esc_attr( $image_class )
                                            );
                                            $loop++;
                                        }
                                    ?></div>
                                    <?php
                                }
                        14. No notice here, there is a foreach loop and all of our gallery images are print from sprintf() function.
                        15. Now we are going to add an id inside second if statement's divition (div) which is defined as - [<div class="thumbnails <?php echo 'columns-' . $columns; ?>"></div>]
                        16. This id comes from our theme > assets > js > script.js [items:4] activation id. [owl-single-product-thumbnails]
                                before: <div class="thumbnails <?php echo 'columns-' . $columns; ?>"></div>
                                after : <div id="owl-single-product-thumbnails" class="thumbnails <?php echo 'columns-' . $columns; ?>"></div>
                        17. Now reload the Single page. Owl Carousel is almost done. We neet to fix some style for this stage.
                        18. Notice carefuly, we have a dynamic class with id. [class="thumbnails <?php echo 'columns-' . $columns; ?>"]. Remove the class and reload again. Near almost.
                        19. Add some style in class="owl-item" as bellow - 
                                #owl-single-product-thumbnails {
                                    margin-top: 15px;
                                }
                                #owl-single-product-thumbnails .owl-item {
                                    margin-right: 2px;
                                }
                                #owl-single-product-thumbnails .owl-item img {
                                    width: 89%;
                                }

141. Now open detail.html from template and notice there are 3 parts. 1st one is the product with gallery which we opened from Shop page. Second one is description part and 3rd one is for related products part.
142. Now open our theme > woocommerce > single-product.php. Notice there is a while loop inside div class="col-md-9" which says there is a template part named 'content single-product'. [<?php wc_get_template_part( 'content', 'single-product' ); ?>]
143. Inside our theme > woocommerce there is no file named 'content single-product' file. So we need to copy that file from woocommerce plugin.
144. Open plugins > woocommerce > templates and copy content-single-product.php and paste it to our theme > woocommerce. Open this file in editor.
145. There are some do_action() function is present here in this file. Notice that there is a do_action('woocommerce_single_product_summary') which hooks title, rating, price etc.
146. Inspect the 1st part from detail.html and notice the parent div class="detail-block"
                1. Go to single-product.php and replace class="clearfix filters-container m-t-10" which is inside class="col-md-9" by class="detail-block"
                        before: <div class="clearfix filters-container m-t-10">
                        after : <div class="detail-block">
                2. Reload Single product page.
                3. Copy this div and paste 2 times (total 3) after this div is finished. Make parallal. Also close those div.
		        do_action( 'woocommerce_after_main_content' );
	                ?>
			    </div>
			    <div class="detail-block">
			    </div>
			    <div class="detail-block">
			    </div>
                4. Second  div is for descriptions and the 3rd div is for related product.
                5. Copy product description hook from content-single-product.php (woocommerce_output_product_data_tabs) and paste it to 2nd div (description div).
                        <?php woocommerce_output_product_data_tabs(); ?>
                6. Copy related product hook from content-single-product.php (woocommercwoocommerce_output_related_productse_output_product_data_tabs) and paste it to 3rd div (related product div).
                        <?php woocommerce_output_related_products(); ?>
                7. Code looks like bellow - 
		        do_action( 'woocommerce_after_main_content' );
	                ?>
			    </div>
			    <div class="detail-block">
                                <?php woocommerce_output_product_data_tabs(); ?>
			    </div>
			    <div class="detail-block">
                                <?php woocommerce_output_related_products(); ?>
			    </div>
                9. Comment do_action( 'woocommerce_after_single_product_summary' ); from content-single-product.php to not to echo for some time.
                10. Inspect tab (description part) from detail.html and copy the class name (class="product-tabs inner-bottom-xs  wow fadeInUp animated") and paste it to single-product.php 2nd div (description div) class. Actually replace 'product-tabs inner-bottom-xs  wow fadeInUp animated' by 'detail-block'. Also copy inline css if present.
			before: 
                                <div class="detail-block">
                                    <?php woocommerce_output_product_data_tabs(); ?>
			        </div>
                            
			after: 
                                <div class="product-tabs inner-bottom-xs  wow fadeInUp animated" style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;">
                                    <?php woocommerce_output_product_data_tabs(); ?>
			        </div>
                11. Inspect tab (related product part) from detail.html and copy the class name (class="section featured-product wow fadeInUp animated") and paste it to single-product.php 3rd div (related product div) class. Actually replace 'section featured-product wow fadeInUp animated' by 'detail-block'. Also copy inline css if present.
			before: 
                                <div class="detail-block">
                                    <?php woocommerce_output_related_products(); ?>
			        </div>
                            
			after: 
                                <div class="section featured-product wow fadeInUp animated" style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;">
                                    <?php woocommerce_output_related_products(); ?>
			        </div>
                12. Reload the page and we can see the divide part.
